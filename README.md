<span>Open and Private software</span>

& <span>Wasora is a convenient high-level interface to perform
mathematical computations. It also provides a framework which other
particular computational codes can use. It is a free computational tool
designed to aid a cognizant expert to analyze complex systems by solving
mathematical problems by means of a high-level plain-text</span> &

\

\

& <span>Milonga is a free core-level neutronic code that solves the
steady-state multigroup neutron transport equation (using the diffusion
approximation, discrete ordinates $S_N$ method or the method of
characteristics) over unstructured grids (although simple structured
grids can also be used) using either a finite-volumes or a
finite-elements discretization scheme.</span> &

\

\

& <span>Mate solves steady-state systems involving mixtures of steam and
water (Two-Phase Flow) in different one dimensional, but still complex,
geometries. Mass, Momentum, and Energy distributions are obtained
through a finite difference scheme. It is intended to be free and open
in the short term.</span> &
